## Description

A Content Management System (CMS) designed for company use in creating a structure of departments, roles, and employees, and allowing for easy manipulation and population of the database.

## Installation

Node.js is required, but after that, install NPM's using "npm i".

## Usage

Run the server from node by typing "node server.js", then simply follow the prompts. However, after each selection, node server will need to be run again. This will be fixed in future releases.

## Tools

The following tools were used in the development of this project:

- JavaScript
- API's
- Node.js
- Express
- mySQL

## Roadmap

Main projects for future development will revolve around more validation in answers, condensed coding, and more options. Methods for deleting departments and roles are already in the code, but require more validation to uphold the integrity of the database.
